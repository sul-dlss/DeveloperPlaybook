# Testing

Some resources to get us started:

## RSpec

* http://betterspecs.org/

### RSpec Style Guide

* https://github.com/reachlocal/rspec-style-guide

## Code Coverage

While imperfect, code coverage is a helpful tool to identify code that is never executed in the course of running tests.

* put badge on repo README

### Coveralls

* works nicely with travis

## Continuous Integration

* whenever possible, CI results should be visible with the code repo.

### Travis

* use travis for CI for github repos
* put travis badge on repo README
* (which rubies to test)
