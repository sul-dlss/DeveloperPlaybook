## Goals

The goals of the Developer Playbook are to:

- Provide a description of current accepted best practices within DLSS. These are not necessarily _everyone's_ best practices, and they will certainly change in the future, but they're ours for the moment.
- Determine whether we have consensus on those practices, to document the ones that we do agree on, and have a list of issues for further discussion.
- Provide documentation about when our local best practices diverge from other established best practices, and provide opportunities to re-assess whether we still believe that our local practices are actually "best."
- Provide a starting point for new projects to build upon past, demonstrated successes, and have a default set of expectations in the absence of other requirements. We choose these acknowledged best practices by default, and discuss and justify any deviations from them.
- Provide a set of guiding directions for new hires to learn the ways of DLSS so they can quickly come up to speed and fit in with established development methodology.
- Mitigate against technical debt in the future by having consistency and coherency in development practices.

The goals are explicitly **NOT** to:

- Mandate or set in stone any unbreakable requirements. They are expectations that can be deviated from for good, documented reasons.
- Generate technical debt by retroactively applying current consensus to past projects.
- Have job description requirements for new hires.

The process is:

- broad, imperfect, and rapid. Future discussions can take it deep, refine the discussions, and go more slowly and carefully.
- modifiable under its own rules, as needed, and as and when desired.
