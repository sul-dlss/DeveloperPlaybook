# Developer Playbook
A place to organize style guides, collect our current local best practices, tools, and techniques for Stanford University's Digital Library Systems &amp; Services Group.

Organized in a similar manner and inspired by the [thoughtbot playbook](http://playbook.thoughtbot.com/) and [thoughtbot guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides)

Goals
-----

The goals of building the Developer Playbook are to:

 - Provide a description of current accepted best practices within DLSS.  These are not necessarily *everyone's* best practices, and they will certainly change in the future, but they're ours for the moment.
 - Determine whether we have consensus on those practices, to document the ones that we do agree on, and have a list of issues for further discussion.
 - Provide documentation about when our local best practices diverge from other established best practices, and provide opportunities to reassess whether we still believe that our local practices are actually "best".    
 - Provide a starting point for new projects to build upon past, demonstrated successes, and have a default set of expectations in the absence of other requirements. We choose these acknowledged best practices by default, and discuss and justify any deviations from them. 
 - Provide a set of guiding directions for new hires to learn the ways of DLSS so they can quickly come up to speed and fit in with established development methodology.
 - Mitigate against technical debt in the future by having consistency and coherency in development practices.

 The goals are explicitly NOT to:

 - Mandate or set in stone any unbreakable requirements. They are expectations that can be deviated from for good, documented reasons.
 - Generate technical debt by retroactively applying current consensus to past projects
 - Have job description requirements for new hires.

The process is:

 - broad, imperfect and rapid.  Future discussions can take it deep, refine the discussions, and go more slowly and carefully.
 - modifiable under its own rules, as needed, and as and when desired.
