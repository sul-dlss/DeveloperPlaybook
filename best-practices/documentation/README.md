# Documentation

## Ruby
Ruby projects should use [YARD](http://yardoc.org/) for documentation purposes.

[Getting Started with YARD](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md)

One benefit is YARD runs a live documentation server for the community, hosting docs for all RubyGems and Github projects. The project is at [RubyDoc.info](http://www.rubydoc.info/) (formerly rdoc.info)
