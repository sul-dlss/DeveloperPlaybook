# Debugging in Javascript

If you'd like to use stepwise debugging in javascript, consider using the following procedure when working in VSCode.

* Type `<CMD><Shift>p` to bring up the command palette
* Search for “Debug: JavaScript Debug Terminal”
* In the terminal enter your test invocation, e.g. `npx jest __test__/components/Whatever.test.js`
* You can set breakpoints in the left margin and use the controls to step through the test.
