## Getting Feedback

Since these are our guides, we want everyone at DLSS to have an opportunity to discuss them. To ensure a reasonable amount of time for discussion and consensus building, we try to leave all pull requests open for at least a week. 

## Providing Feedback

During discussion on a topic, participants are are welcome to offer feedback liberally to make sure all angles are considered. Objections should not be raised unless the individual strongly believes the decision is the wrong one in spite of discussion, and the individual cannot "live with" the decision. Compromise on points that the individual considers suboptimal but can "live with" is an essential part of group decisions that must meet various requirements. (Adapted from http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/consensus-procedures)

After reviewing a proposal, participants who generally support the propsal but have no specific feedback to offer are encouraged to comment with :+1: (`:+1:`) to indicate their support.

Participants with objections are encouraged to comment with :-1` (`:-1:`) and provide specific feedback about their concerns.
