# Developer Onboarding
The official onboarding process will take six weeks, after which we will be able to gather feedback about the process and collect changes for the next time. We recognize that mentoring a new developer is an important job that will require the mentor to take significant time off their regular work. Training a new hire is not just the responsibility of the supervisor and mentor, but the entire team. However, mentors are expected to take ownership of the process.  DLSS' technology stack and project portfolios are large and complicated, so try to pace the new developer carefully so he or she doesn’t feel as if they’re drinking from the fire-hose!


#### Goals:
- Make the new hire feel welcome and happy.
- Help the new hire become productive as soon as possible.
- Explain how we work.
  - (e.g. use pull requests, use GitHub, test) and what technologies we prefer, in order to avoid people going off on their own and implementing workflows that are incompatible with the rest of the department.



Note: As a mentor, your responsibility is to help the new hire to go through the [New Staff Checklist](https://consul.stanford.edu/display/DSG/New+Staff+Checklist), which has additional admin info that applies to all new DLSS hires.

## Pre-arrival
- SUnet ID
- Laptop (at least 2 weeks lead time, requires manager approval)
- Schedule appointment for door access via Stanford ID
- Get physical equipment ready. This includes desk, chair, monitor, etc
- Appoint a mentor
- Assign the developer to a team. New developers should not be left to work on a project alone.
- Ensure that both the mentor and the supervisor of the new hire are present for their first day.

## Ongoing Tasks
- [__Pair programming__](https://github.com/sul-dlss/DeveloperPlaybook/blob/master/best-practices/pair_programming.md)
- Check in at least twice a day
- Taking the new hires to meetings & standups
- Ensure they can find lunch
- Take notes on onboarding process (mentor and mentee)
