See testing-practices directory

## Dependencies
(sub dir will have info on Gemfiles (about how to comment when pinning a version) and other types of dependencies, gemnasium ...)

## Versioning
(will have info about semantic versioning)

## Code Complexity
(possibly hook up with code climate to auto-find nasty bits)

## Exception Handling

## Robustness
